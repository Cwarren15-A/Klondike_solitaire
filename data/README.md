# Klondike Solitaire Learning Data

This directory contains the persistent learning data that powers the AI system's continuous improvement.

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

### Automatic Learning
- **Every game** (win or loss) is automatically recorded with anonymized patterns
- **AI weights adapt** based on successful vs unsuccessful strategies
- **Move effectiveness** is tracked across different game difficulties
- **Strategic patterns** are identified and reinforced

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: Recent games stored in browser localStorage
- **IndexedDB**: Larger datasets stored locally with IndexedDB
- **Remote Storage**: Aggregated learning data stored in this GitHub repository

### Privacy & Anonymization
- âœ… **No personal information** is stored
- âœ… **Game patterns only** - move sequences, timing, effectiveness
- âœ… **Anonymized analytics** - win rates, strategic insights
- âœ… **No identifying data** - random IDs only

## ðŸ”„ Data Updates

### Automatic Generation
Every 25 games, the system generates a downloadable learning data export:
- Check browser Downloads folder for `solitaire-learning-data-[timestamp].json`
- These files contain the latest anonymized learning patterns

### Manual GitHub Updates
To update the shared learning data:

1. **Download** the generated learning data file from your browser
2. **Replace** `learning-data.json` with the new file
3. **Commit** the changes to GitHub
4. **Deploy** - GitHub Pages will automatically update

### File Structure
```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ learning-data.json     # Main learning database
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file
â””â”€â”€ [future files]        # Additional learning modules
```

## ðŸ§  Learning Capabilities

### What the AI Learns
